    Class that tries to extract numbers from questions. Uses a open souce LLM to do so because I don't want to pay of API calls (might affect quality, but using a relatively big model to compensate)

            Your task is to extract a SINGLE final numerical value from the answer IF one exists.

            Rules:
            1. If the answer contains exactly one unambiguous final numerical value, return only that number.
            2. Ignore units, formatting, commas, and explanatory text.
            3. If there is no numerical value, more than one possible final value, a range, or any ambiguity, return NA.
            4. If the question/answer pair is not relevant to a single final answer (i.e., chemistry formula balancing) then return NA
            5. Your output must be either:
                - The number (digits and decimal point only), or
                - NA
                

            Do not include any explanation, reasoning, commentary, or additional text.
            Output strictly the number or NA.
            Be very decisive; never put 'some number or NA'"""
